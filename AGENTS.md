# Base Rebirth browser port

Work from base Rebirth; keep Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ overlays separate. This
repository and the owner's original assets/captures remain private. The shipped
runtime is reconstructed Rust/WASM; native binaries are reference material.

Keep `TEST_MATRIX.md` synchronized with executable scenarios using
`npm run matrix:update`. Record implementation, original evidence, passing
contracts and unresolved parity separately. Preserve failing comparisons;
never replace a native reference with clone output or relax a pixel gate to pass.

Use `source cloud/env.sh` for the installed toolchain. `npm run check` builds and
tests the production artifact, including original comparisons. Standalone
browser tests require a fresh build. Native Rust/WASM self-equality proves
replay consistency, not original hidden-state or simulation-tick parity.

Coordinate file ownership across parallel agents. Shared temporary tooling and
RE notes belong in ignored `.cache/coordination/`; persist reusable tools and
the evidence needed to reproduce accepted behavior in the repository.
